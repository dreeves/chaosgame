Math + randomness = fractals

by Cantor Soule-Reeves and Daniel Reeves

## Known bugs and issues

1. Sometimes regenerating the image makes it lose all its color and it shows the fractal in only gray. Maybe sometimes it also regenerates things too dim when in hyperspeed?

2. If you click the left arrow button to go to the previous fractal when you're already on the first one ("plain ole sierpinski") then it picks a random fractal and the prev/next buttons are replaced with a single refresh button to get a new fractal. Same if you make it to the last named fractal and click the button for the next one.

Which is fine, but if you want to get back to named fractals then you have to either change the URL (just nix the query string) or else keep refreshing until you randomly land back on one of the named fractals.
